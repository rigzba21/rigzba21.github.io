## Greetings

Welcome to the first post of my blog about random stuff. I don't like to stick to one
theme in particular, since I find a wide variety of topics/areas interesting.  Topics on this blog may
range from electronics, music, books, software development, cooking, pool cleaning, or whatever I feel like writing
about.

### [This Site](https://rigzba21.github.io) and its Content

This is my second attempt at setting up a blog post/website. I using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) at the moment to generate my static site/content. I've experimented with other _Static Site Generators_ like [JBake](https://jbake.org/)
and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), but I decided to give Jekyll and the [Liquid](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/) template engine a shot.  I'm a big fan of Hugo, but I like to try out new things, and Jekyll was next on my list.  

#### My Old Site (Not Active Anymore)  

I've decided to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) as the content delivery network (CDN) provider to host
my static site content instead of trying to host it myself from a [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) application on [Heroku](https://heroku.com). I love the idea of running my own static content from a Spring app, but adding new content and making style/layout updates quickly seems more convenient through the Jekyll/Github Pages combo.

#### The Journey Ahead

Since I come from a stronger C and systems programming background, I'm looking forward
to the web development learning experience. Good things to come.
